Get release data (Albums only) from Discogs thru this API
------------------------------------------------------------

This PHP Class will help you to get the JSON data of a Release from Discogs.com.
At the moment it can only be used for Album's, NOT for Artists, and/or Labels.
Maybe this will come in the future. It depends on if it's necessary.

IF YOU NEED TO GET ARTIS / LABEL DATA, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
When there are enough requests, then I'll add it.

It comply's to the V2 API.

For usage, see the beginning of the PHP file.
